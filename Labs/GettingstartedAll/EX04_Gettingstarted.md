# Developing AI Applications with Azure AI Foundry: Fine-Tuning Prompts for Optimal Performance

## Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview 

This lab is intended for AI developers, data scientists, cloud engineers, and AI enthusiasts aiming to gain hands-on experience in building, refining, and evaluating AI workflows using Azure AI Foundry's Prompt Flow. Participants will learn to initialize Prompt Flow projects, create and customize prompts, and build flows using LLM and Prompt tools. The lab also focuses on prompt engineering best practices, including structuring input queries for optimal AI performance and iterating on prompt design for consistent, accurate results. Through practical exercises, participants will develop, test, and monitor AI-driven workflows to enhance reliability and output quality.

## Objectives 

By completing this lab, participants will learn to create effective prompts, develop flows with LLM tools, and optimize prompt design for improved AI performance.

- **Initialize a Prompt Flow Project**: ou will learn how to set up a structured Prompt Flow project in Azure AI Foundry by creating a project directory, configuring essential files, and organizing resources to streamline the design, testing, and refinement of prompt-based AI workflows.

- **Create and Customize Prompts**: You will learn how to design and tailor prompts to guide LLMs effectively, aligning them with specific objectives and use cases to enhance the accuracy, relevance, and impact of AI-generated responses.

- **Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools**: You will learn how to build a flow using LLM and Prompt tools by defining objectives, crafting and refining prompts, and leveraging model outputs to create effective, task-specific AI workflows.

- **Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison**: You will learn how to refine prompts through successive iterations and compare output variants to systematically improve the accuracy, relevance, and effectiveness of model responses.

- **Optimize Flow Performance for Production**: You will learn how to analyze and refine workflows by identifying bottlenecks, applying best practices, and implementing continuous monitoring to ensure efficient, reliable, and scalable production performance.
